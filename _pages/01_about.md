This is my first attempt at using [Jekyll][jekyll].
I was following the tutorial
[Make a Static Website with Jekyll][tutorial]
at [www.taniarascia.com][taniarascia].
Further experimentation may follow.

This is the about page.
It uses the **{{ page.layout }}** layout
and lives in *\_pages/01\_about.md*
